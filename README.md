# Verde

A legacy client-facing retail web-portal needed a complete redesign and modernization. Our team of four engineers at Verde redesigned the portal and implemented features that enable customers to search, browse, add to cart, and checkout.

## Motivation

Verde is a project created by the team to flex our front-end development skills.
